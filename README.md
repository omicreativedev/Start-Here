# Start-Here
Blog and Directory of repositories, contributions, etc.

The objective in creating this repository is simply to keep track of my personal Github hightlights. I happen to fork a lot of repos, so those viewing my profile may not be able to distinguish my creations and contributions from research or learning repos. This repository is thus a means to organize my profile in such a way that visitors can navigate it more easily. This too is a work in progress.
